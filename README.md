Software Engineering Project for Queen Mary University of London (second year, second semester). 
The team had to develop a Garage Management System (GM-SIS) according to the documented requirements. The system stores and manages data regarding the customer and their vehicles held by the garage. 

Each team member received an individual grade. My personal grade for the project was 88.4%. My personal contribution to the effort was:
Team leader and also responsible for the Vehicle module and common part such as User Registration and Authentication  of the software.

Used Scrum methodology, Java, Object-Oriented Programming, UML diagrams, MVC design pattern, JavaFX for GUI, Git Hub and SQLite in the project. This repository represents my developed part of the system.
