I have managed a six-person group in my second-year software engineering project. Arranged scrum meetings regularly to discuss our strategies, and decisions as well as review the progress. We have de-veloped a desktop application that stores and manages data regarding the customer and their vehicles held by the garage. Used Scrum methodology, Java, Object-Oriented Programming, UML diagrams, MVC design pattern, Git Hub and SQLite in the project.
